# Notifications

## Definition

Notifications provide an automated way to receive updates about the Vessels you care most about. By default, a Vessel will send a notification for the following events:

* If the Vessel errors out
* If the Vessel is triggered On Demand
* If the Vessel's Blueprint is made Inactive

When initially creating a Vessel, the owner's email will be added automatically. You can always add additional user emails to be notified about the Vessel, or remove the owner's email. Emails provided do not have to have access to Shipyard to receive a notification.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip**: You can paste a comma-separated list of emails into the field and it will automatically separate them all.
{% endhint %}

## Limitations

1. Notifications can only be sent via email. No other messaging platforms are supported at this time.
2. Notification settings are the same for every user that is listed.
3. Notifications are only sent for 3 different event types. These event types cannot be changed.
4. Notifications are only applied at the Vessel level. You cannot subscribe to notifications for a Blueprint \(and therefore all dependent Vessels\).
