# On Demand Triggers

## Definition

On top navigation pane for every Vessel, you are given a **Run Now** button in the top-right. Clicking this button will cause the Vessel to save changes and trigger a Vessel to schedule an immediate run.

## Limitations

1. Vessels may not run instantaneously, as there is still time associated with entering a job queue and spinning up servers.
2. If you are currently on the Logs tab, clicking **Run Now** may schedule an On Demand run in the background, with no visibile indication. Refresh the page to see the newly created run.
