# Triggers

## Definition

Triggers are the logic that determines when a Vessel begins running. They are set on the "Triggers" tab of a Vessel.  
  
There are currently 3 types of supported triggers:

* [Schedule Triggers](schedule-triggers.md)
* [Internal Triggers](internal-triggers.md)
* [On Demand Triggers](on-demand-triggers.md)

## Limitations

1. There is currently no way to view the overlap between multiple types of triggers.
2. A Vessel cannot run on both Schedule Triggers and Internal Triggers at the same time. You have to choose one or another.
