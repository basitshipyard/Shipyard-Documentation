# Blueprint Library

## Definition

The Blueprint Library is a location for pre-made Custom Blueprints developed by Shipyard staff. These Blueprints provide an easy way to avoid monotonous development work associated with integrations. We designed these Blueprints to:

* Accomplish a single common action with with a single vendor
* Require no coding
* Require minimal details and credentials

Adding a Blueprint to your organization creates a copy of the original Blueprint in your organization. At that point, you can manipulation the code and environment variables as you see fit. 

In an effort to be transparent about how our Blueprints work, we open-source the code and make it  available on our [Github](https://github.com/shipyardapp). The repositories are broken up by vendor and all end in `-blueprints`. If some functionality isn't working appropriately, you can open an issue in Github or submit a pull request with the proposed changes. 

As Blueprints get updated, we will create new release tags and send out a notification to all users that actively use the Blueprint. In most cases, you can simply update the version tag on the requirements tab.
