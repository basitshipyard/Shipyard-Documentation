# Glossary of Terms

## Definitions

**Blueprint Library** is a location for pre-made Custom Blueprints developed by Shipyard staff.

[**Blueprints**](blueprints/) ****are the foundation of the application. They contain the design specifications for a repeatable task. In other applications, these may be referenced as templates, macros, or operators.

\*\*\*\*[**Vessels**](vessels/) are built using Blueprints. In other applications, these may be referenced as tasks or jobs.

\*\*\*\*[**Fleets**](fleets/) are built by connecting multiple Vessels together. In other applications, these may be referenced as workflows or DAGs.

**Voyages** are a single run of a Vessel or Fleet. Data about a Voyage is stored as a Log.

\*\*\*\*[**Logs**](logs/) are a historical record of how a Fleet or Vessel voyage at a specific point in time. A Fleet's log will contain multiple Vessel Logs.

[**Triggers**](triggers/) ****are the logic that determines when a Vessel or Fleet should begin running.

\*\*\*\*[**Projects**](projects.md) house Vessels and Fleets that you have created under them. Each project is associated with it's own timezone.

\*\*\*\*[**Organizations**](what-is-an-organization.md) house all of your Projects and Blueprints. This is the highest grouping structure in the platform that users can control.

**Element** refers to any of the above bolded words.

**Platform** refers to the Shipyard application as a whole. Elements that live under the Platform level are controlled and managed by Shipyard staff.
