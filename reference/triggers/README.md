# Triggers

## Definition

Triggers are the logic that determines when either a [Vessel](../vessels/) or a [Fleet](../fleets/) begins running. They are set on the "Triggers" tab.  
  
There are currently 2 types of supported triggers:

* [Schedule Triggers](schedule-triggers.md)
* [On Demand Triggers](on-demand-triggers.md)

## Limitations

1. There is currently no way to view the overlap between different triggers at different levels.
