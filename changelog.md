This new feature will provide better visibility into the progress of Vessels without requiring users to constantly refresh the page.

  * Word highlighting

  * Lines without wraparound

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where the error message for unnamed Vessels would shift the spacing of all the fields on the Information Tab.
* Timestamps on the Log page no longer overlap on smaller screens.

## 4/14/2020

ðŸŒŸ **Enhancements:**

* Retries have an updated look! We've refined the design to give you better visibility into:
  * When the next retry is going to occur
  * What retry number Shipyard is currently on
  * Visibly see when something is currently retrying
* If your Vessel uses a Custom Blueprint, you'll now see a link to go directly to that Blueprint. This will make navigation throughout the application a bit easier.

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

* Trying to access an organization that you don't have permissions for will result in an explicit error message and be redirected to their list of organizations. Previously, this landed you on a broken page.
* When you refresh the page, projects on the sidebar will no longer disappear.
* Fixed an error where the Blueprint field would just say "Blueprint".

## 4/2/2020

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where Blueprint names couldn't be duplicated across the application.

## 3/31/2020

ðŸŽ‰ **New Features:**

You can now create a new organization directly through the UI!

ðŸŒŸ **Enhancements:**

ðŸŽ‰ **New Features:**

* [User Management](reference/admin/user-management.md) page for viewing, managing, and deleting users
* User Invite System for growing your organization and collaborating with outside parties.
* [User Permissions Panel](reference/admin/user-permissions.md) to set granular access settings per user.

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

* Fixed Google SSO issue that some users were having.

## 2/18/2020

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

* Fixed issue where a Log's output would sometimes not refresh correctly.
