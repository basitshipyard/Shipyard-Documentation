## Features On Deck

* Share Data and Files Across Vessels in a Fleet
* Conditional Triggers based on Vessel Status
* Converging Paths for Fleets
* Watch your Vessels Run - LIVE!

## 4/14/2020

ðŸŒŸ **Enhancements:**

* Retries have an updated look! We've refined the design to give you better visibility into:
  * When the next retry is going to occur
  * What retry number Shipyard is currently on
  * Visibly see when something is currently retrying
* If your Vessel uses a Custom Blueprint, you'll now see a link to go directly to that Blueprint. This will make navigation throughout the application a bit easier.

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

* Trying to access an organization that you don't have permissions for will result in an explicit error message and be redirected to their list of organizations. Previously, this landed you on a broken page.
* When you refresh the page, projects on the sidebar will no longer disappear.
* Fixed an error where the Blueprint field would just say "Blueprint".

## 4/2/2020

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where Blueprint names couldn't be duplicated across the application.

## 3/31/2020

ðŸŽ‰ **New Features:**

You can now create a new organization directly through the UI!

ðŸŒŸ **Enhancements:**

* Selecting your Timezone when creating a project is now easier, with more common Timezones listed at the top.

* Guardrails from Blueprints now transfer to Vessels set up with that Blueprint.
* Removed the ability to add the current Vessel as an Internal Trigger.

ðŸŽ‰ **New Features:**

* [User Management](reference/admin/user-management.md) page for viewing, managing, and deleting users

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

## 2/18/2020

ðŸ”§ **Bug Fixes:**

* Fixed issue where a Log's output would sometimes not refresh correctly.
